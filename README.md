# JavaScript Fundamentals (Practice Exercises & Mini Projects)
This repo documents my journey in learning JavaScript from scratch (again). It includes practice exercises, notes, and mini console-based applications for building core JS skills.

## Topics Covered 
Last Update: 2025-05-06
- Variables: `let`, `const`, `var` (mutability, scope)
- Data Types: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, `null`, `undefined`, Objects, Arrays
- Type Coercion & Equality: `===` vs `==`, truthy/falsy, `typeof`, `NaN`
- Control Flow: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `break`, `continue`
- Functions: declarations, expressions, arrow functions, parameters vs arguments
- Scope: global, function, block scope, lexical scope, hoisting, TDZ
- Arrays: indexing, methods (`push`, `pop`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`), destructuring
- Objects: key-value structure, methods, `this`, dot vs bracket notation
- Classes: ES6 class syntax, constructors, static methods, inheritance (`extends`, `super`)
- Codewars Challenges: practicing 8â€“6 kyu problems focusing on conditionals, arrays, and refactoring
- Projects: Tic-Tac-Toe with grid logic, Console Contact Book, Pet Hotel (Class and OOP-like Practice)

## What's Next?
Last Update: 2025-06-11
As of June 11, 2025: took a break from fulltime JavaScript study to start Java Fundamentals. I'll continue practicing fundamentals on Codewars and revisit JavaScript for more advanced topics like asynchronous programming, DOM manipulation, and event handling after completing Java basics. Will also explore frameworks like React and Node.js and backend development.
